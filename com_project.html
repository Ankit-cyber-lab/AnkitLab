            <p colour style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size: 120%;">The Santragachi and Ramrajatala areas in Howrah were previously undeveloped. There were only two high schools; "Santragachi Madhya Engreji School" and "Chakraberia Madhyamik School". Both were English medium and aided by the Government. A "toll" or "pathsala" was started in 1770 by the Bhattacharya family. In 1800, Gourikanta Bhattacharya expanded the toll which existed up to 1860. In 1857, zamindar Baboo Kedarnath Bhattacharya established a vernacular Bengali medium school with the help of Government aid. It was the first vernacular Bengali medium school to receive Government aid. In 1864, this school was demolished by cyclone, and was removed to the house of Kedarnath Bhattacharya, where it stayed for two years. At a cost of â‚¹4000/- a new pucca building was constructed for the school.In 1870, this school was amalgamated with Santragachi Madhya Engraji School and named the Santragachi Minor School. An educationist and zamindar, Manmatanath Seth, wanted to build a high school for the children of the locality, so he donated a grant of money. The Kar brothers (Mahendranath Kar, Upendranath Kar and Narendranath Kar) donated land, but Manmatanath Seth died before the High school could be constructed. The Kar brothers built the school using the donations for the students of Santragachi Minor School and in November 1925, this was named "Kedarnath Institution" in the name of Baboo Kedarnath Bhattacharya who had died in 1915.The foundation year is now considered as 1925.
            The foundation stone was laid by the vice-chancellor and professor of Ashutosh College, Ashutosh Mukherjee on 17 July 1920. From 1925, the newly named institution started functioning with 225 students in six classrooms. In 1926, the class for the ninth standard started with the temporary permission of Calcutta University, and in 1927, after the completion of the tenth standard, the school's students were sent for board exams the first time. In 1933, the school received its permanent affiliation from the West Bengal Board. In 1960, the school was recognised by the University Of Calcutta, to impact Elementary Scientific knowledge and Elementary Mechanics to the students.
